# Dynamic-Modelling-Simulation-and-Control-of-Asymmetrical-VTOL-Multi-Rotor-UAVs
The basic framework of this investigative project is set around the design and development of control software for Vertical/Short Take-off and Landing (VSTOL) model aircraft. From this theme, the aims of modelling and simulating the non-linear dynamics of an asymmetrical VTOL multi-rotor platform and the development of multiple control schemes, such as Proportional Integral Derivative, Linear Quadratic Gaussian and Model Predictive control algorithms, were derived. These control schemes will then be implemented on the modelled multi-rotor platform via an embedded microprocessor unit. 

These aims break down into multiple objective and milestones which must each be achieved to fulfil the full scope of that the aims outlined. These objectives can be broadly classified into 2 categories: 

Basic Objectives 
1. Develop a mathematical model representing the dynamics of the multi-rotor aircraft. 
2. Develop a dynamic simulation of the crafts behaviour.
3. Develop feedback control laws: Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG). 
4. Investigate feedback control laws in simulation with the mathematical model to achieve behavioural targets. 
5. Develop flight control software to interface with sensors and implement control laws. 
6. Implement the flight control software on an embedded microprocessor unit. 
7. Implement controller unto multi-rotor platform. 
8. Discuss the results of performance comparisons between the simulation and hardware implementations. 

Advanced Objectives 
1. Investigate the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) schemes in simulation. 
2. Incorporate and implement MPC schemes unto the flight control software. 
3. Discuss the differences between the LQG and MPC implementations
